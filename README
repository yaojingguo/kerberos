Kerberos Setup
==============
Kerberos realm is EXAMPLE.COM. KDC and admin server is 
jingguolin.example.com. xiaoyu/play@EXAMPLE.COM is used for both user 
and service.

Setting Options
===============
To set java.security.policy, both "-Djava.security.policy==" and 
"-Djava.security.policy=" can be used. But they have different 
meanings. The same is for setting java.security.auth.login.config.
